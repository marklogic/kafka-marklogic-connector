# MarkLogic Kafka Connector

The MarkLogic Kafka connector is a [Kafka Connect](https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/connect/index.html)
sink and source connector. It supports writing data from a topic to a MarkLogic database as well as reading data from
a MarkLogic database via an [Optic query](https://docs.marklogic.com/guide/app-dev/OpticAPI) and sending the result to a topic.

Please see [the User Guide](http://marklogic.github.io/kafka-marklogic-connector) for more information.

For developing and testing the MarkLogic Kafka connector, please see the [guide on contributing](/CONTRIBUTING.md).
That guide also includes detailed instructions on how to use both Confluent Platform and Apache Kafka which may be
useful if you are new to either product.
