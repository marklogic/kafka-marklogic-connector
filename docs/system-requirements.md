The MarkLogic Kafka connector has the following system requirements:

* Kafka 2.5 or higher, or Confluent Platform 7 or higher
* For writing data, MarkLogic 9 or higher.
* For reading data, MarkLogic 10.0-6 or higher.

The MarkLogic Kafka connector may work on versions of Kafka prior to 2.5 or Confluent Platform prior to 7, but it has
not been tested on those.
