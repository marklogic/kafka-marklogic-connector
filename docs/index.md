The MarkLogic Kafka connector is a [Kafka Connect](https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/connect/index.html) 
sink and source connector. It supports writing data from a topic to a MarkLogic database as well as reading data from
a MarkLogic database via an [Optic query](https://docs.marklogic.com/guide/app-dev/OpticAPI) and sending the result to a topic.

This user guide describes how to obtain the MarkLogic Kafka connector and how to use it with either Confluent Platform 
or Apache Kafka. It is expected that if you are considering usage of the MarkLogic Kafka connector, you already have 
a basic level of understanding of Kafka and/or Confluent Platform.
